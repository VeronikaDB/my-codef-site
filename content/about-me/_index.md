This is me!

My name's Veronika and I'm finishing my master's degree in Money and Finance at Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main. I am from **Slovenia** but I currently live in **Amsterdam**, where I did my QTEM exchange.

From **September** on, I will be a Trainee in the Market Infrastructure & Payments Department at the _ECB_.
